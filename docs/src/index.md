GraphCombinations.jl generates non-isomorphic multigraph topologies for a prescribed set of vertex degrees, with Feynman-diagram generation as the primary use case.

A vertex specification `n` uses `n[k]` for the number of degree-`k` vertices. Degree-1 vertices are fixed external vertices; internal vertices are quotient-labeled under degree-preserving relabelings. Parallel edges and self-loops/tadpoles are supported.

```julia
using GraphCombinations

graphs = allgraphs([2, 0, 0, 2])
```

`allgraphs` returns `(edges, S)` pairs, where `edges` is a canonical `Vector{Pair{Int,Int}}` representation and `S::BigInt` is the exact symmetry denominator of the topology.

The production generator enumerates degree-constrained multigraphs directly instead of first constructing all Wick pairings. It uses a hybrid exact reduction strategy: low-redundancy inputs canonicalize completed graphs directly, while larger internal relabeling sectors quotient isomorphic partial states at completed multiplicity-row boundaries. Public representatives, result ordering, and symmetry denominators remain deterministic and exact. A brute-force Wick implementation is retained internally as a small-system correctness oracle.

## Weighted colored-port generation

For downstream diagram engines that need directed, typed half-edge matching rather than scalar degree sequences, `ColoredPortProblem` provides an exact weighted colored-port generator.

```julia
problem = ColoredPortProblem(
    fill(1, 3),
    ones(Int, 3, 1),
    ones(Int, 3, 1),
    trues(1, 1),
)

completions = generate_weighted(problem)
```

Rows of the source/target count matrices are vertices and columns are opaque port colors. The pair-local admissibility relation may depend on both endpoint vertices and endpoint colors. Exact matching multiplicities are accumulated as `BigInt`, while fixed external vertices and admissibility-preserving relabelings are respected during partial-state quotienting.

`generate_weighted_with_stats` additionally reports search-state, canonicalization, merge and pruning counters. A concrete pruning policy may be supplied when rejection is invariant under canonical relabeling and monotone under extension.

Signed or graded downstream representations can extend `initial_port_weight` and `transport_port_weight` for their own concrete transport type. The transport receives a `PortRelabeling` that maps each accepted raw child into its canonical representative **before** orbit-equivalent contributions are accumulated. GraphCombinations provides only the domain-neutral relabeling; interpretation of any sign or representation factor remains the caller's responsibility.

The package is heavily inspired by [this Mathematica StackExchange post](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/170268/how-to-generate-all-feynman-diagrams-with-mathematica) by AccidentalFourierTransform. A Mathematica notebook based on that approach is available in the [examples folder](https://github.com/oameye/GraphCombinations.jl/tree/main/examples).
